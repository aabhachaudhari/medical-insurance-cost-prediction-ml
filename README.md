# Medical Insurance Cost Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on accurately predicting medical insurance expenses to support both insurance providers and policyholders in financial planning and risk assessment. By analyzing demographic and health-related attributes such as **age, BMI, smoking status, number of dependents, gender, and region**, the system applies multiple machine learning techniques to deliver cost predictions and risk categorizations.

## 📌 **Objectives**
- Predict individual medical insurance cost using regression models.
- Identify cost-risk groups using classification techniques.
- Discover natural data segments using clustering for risk profiling.
- Provide a data-driven approach for fair and transparent premium decisions.
